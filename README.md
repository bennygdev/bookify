# Bookify
A react front-end web application made for a school project. I decided to use react to develop the website for interactivity. This was made to communicate with microsoft's core web API backend locally hosted on my computer, which i also had made alongside. Backend uploading soon hopefully. Enhancing and completely revamping the user interface plus adding statistics was one of my plans for this website but due to time constraints i could not do it, but hopefully I can revisit and make this look much more prettier. 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
